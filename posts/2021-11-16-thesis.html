      <p><b>Take your idea/concept and do research to find out where it fits in the world of research (how is your idea different than what already exists in that genre) and develop/build a concept map.</b></p>

      <p>My focus will be on doing digital work outdoors and/or not at a desk.</p>
      <p>Existing related areas of research that exist today include:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Better display technology, including e-ink displays, which are clearer outdoors and require less electricity (also making it more suitable for outdoor devices)</li>
       <li>Watches, smart clothing, and other wearables, which would free our hands and eliminate the need for us to carry a heavy device.</li>
       <li>Augmented Reality, which gives us a way of interacting with the real world (albeit through our screens) rather than a simulated world.</li>
