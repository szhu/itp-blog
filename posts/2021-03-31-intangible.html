       I was originally excited to use the Arduino as Wi-Fi and HTTP client,
       connecting to the internet just like any other computing device and
       interacting with some cool APIs. However, the sample code never was able
       to connect to the Wi-Fi router!
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that the router in my apartment is only supplying a 5GHz
       network, and the Arduino's Wi-Fi module only works with 2.4GHz networks.
       The router is not mine, so I didn't want to reconfigure it. Time for
       another plan…

         Instead I used the Arduino as a Wi-Fi access point and HTTP server, and
         used it to serve a small game:

         To play, the player first taps a hole for the rabbit to hide the
         carrots in. Then, the player must tape the same hole to retrieve the
         carrots. This is a trivial task and obviously should be expanded on to
         make an interesting game. However, even it its current state:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          It could be a fun game for small children to teach them object
          permanence.
         </li>
         <li>
          It could be a fun game for inebriated people to teach them object
          permanence.
         </li>
         <li>
          Multiple people can connect to the server at the same time to cause a
          lot of chaos.
         </li>
         <li>
          It can be used as a memory game, or a habit-forming aid, if the player
          allows for a long time between placing the carrot and retrieving the
          carrot.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The game is simple, but I made sure it was complex enough to require
         the server to store game state ✨ to prevent cheating ✨ since the
         stakes in this game are very high.

         To create the game, I mentally mapped out the game's possible states.
         Some of the states would be only directly accessible to the server, and
         some were ok to show the client. I had the server store whether the
         carrot was stored in a hole, and, if so, which hole. All the remaining
         aspects of the state were fairly transient, and could be stored in the
         URL or in a meta refresh tag to indicate the state to advance to after
         a 2-second delay.

         This is a simplified state diagram, not showing the states
         corresponding to which hole the carrot was stored in, and the hole the
         player decided to look at.
        </p>
        <p>
         To prototype the code, I made a client-only version that uses only JS
         and doesn't interact with a server. (The Arduino version of the game
         also doesn't use JavaScript at all!) Both versions of the game look
         exactly the same.
