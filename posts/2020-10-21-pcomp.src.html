<section id="PComp Labs Week 6">
  <section id="Another week, another setup change">
    <md>
      Adjusting my setup is honestly my favorite part of each lab.
      <!--  -->
      Classes are remote, and I got tired of sitting almost the entire day every
      day! This week, I adjusted my setup to make it just as comfortable to sit
      or stand.

      I also found some new tricks that allowed me to have a better
      documentation setup:
      <!--  -->
      For documentation labs for this class, I typically need to record both the
      screen and the physical world simultaneously. I previously accomplished
      this by taking camera pictures of the circuit juxtaposed with a screen.
      The fidelity on these "screenshots" just isn't super great.
      <!--  -->
      This week, I going to take screen recordings instead. I am now able to
      bring the real world into the screen using these two tricks:
      <!--  -->
      - When I was reading the help manual for QuickTime Player (reading
      documentation is, for some reason, something I do for fun), I found this
      cool feature:

    <img

      src="../files/2020-09-pcomp/week-6/0_setup/Screen Shot 2020-10-21 at 4.25.46 AM.png"
    />
    <md>
      - I searched around for an iPhone app that displays just the camera, with
      no decorations around the image. I finally found one called [Full Screen
      Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/full-screen-camera/id1504011874) --
      it looks like the developer created it specifically for this purpose.
      <!--  -->
      Putting all of this together, I could now capture both worlds in a single
      screen recording. Here's what the setup looks like:
    </md>
    <img src="../files/2020-09-pcomp/week-6/0_setup/DSC01139.JPG" />
    <md>
      There is a slight lag with the phone screen mirroring, but I hope it's not
      too noticeable.

        Using `cat $PORT` as a serial monitor. `cat` is very robust and way less
        finicky than Arduino IDE serial monitor.

        <!--  -->
        ðŸ’¡ This took me way longer than expected to build. I managed to wire
        many wires incorrectly, including having an off-by-one error with the
        Arduino pinout, and forgetting to connect a wire for ground. It was not
        a fun process. :(

      <md>
        ðŸ’¡ I got very stuck doing this part. After about an hour of debugging, I
        figured out that the issue turned out to be that I was using the wrong
        port name. I was using `/dev/cu.usbmodem14201` (because the examples
        used `cu` port names) but the correct port name is
        `/dev/tty.usbmodem14201`.
        <!--  -->
        The `cat` exercise above worked with the `cu` port names! But here the
        `cu` port doesn't work -- it doesn't cause `serial.on('data')` events to
        be fired when data is written to the port for some reason.
        <!--  -->
        Conflating this issue was another issue -- the serial connection often
        doesn't work unless programs are started in this order:
        <!--  -->
        1. Upload code to the Arduino.
        <!--  -->
        2. Restart the "p5.serialcontrol" app and open the port.
        <!--  -->
        3. Refresh the P5 sketch.

        This is was first time using P5. I was impressed by how full-fledged the
        web editor is, and the fact that it was easy for the web app to connect
        to a physical device.
