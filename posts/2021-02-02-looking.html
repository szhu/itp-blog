     My most important takeaway from this week's class is that the focus of
     traditional accessibility technologies is for getting jobs done, rather
     than for other purposes, including entertainment. Trying to dig into why
     this is, I think that it's because the incentive alignment is different
     than that of "normal" technologies.

     Two analogs come to mind. First, a common refrain about why
     enterprise/school software is harder to build than B2C software -- is that
     the buyer isn't the user. Enterprise software often comes with a lot of
     features that no one will actually use but that are table stakes before any
     purchasing manager will approve the purchase.

     Second, there's some critical analysis of why SNAP (the program that gives
     money for food to low-income people) works better than food banks (which
     directly give food to low-income people) -- it's that food banks create a
     redundant system of food storage. (An

     that gives more context.)
    </p>
    <p>
     We already have a system called currency that allows people to
     incrementally convey wants and needs to people who can make things. It's
     not perfect, but when people try to sidestep the process by having a
     middleman convey desires to the people who are in charge of providing or
     building products, a lot of useful information gets inadvertently filtered
     out. For B2B software, what the purchasing managers have filtered out are
     concerns like "this feature that looks useful isn't built well and will
     never be used". For food banks, what policy creators have filtered out is
     that whatever is lost to abuse of SNAP is so small compared to what SNAP
     saves by leveraging our existing economic system.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for accessibility technologies, the message that is lost is that users
     of accessible technologies are human too. And what every human needs is not
     just to work, but also to have a good time. Maybe taking a look at the
     existing analogs can help us come up with a better incentive loop for
     creating accessibility technologies.
