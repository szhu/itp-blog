      <ul>
       <li>
        A cube that dramatizes the shadow that the user casts upon it. It
        contains a light sensor, and changes its light output to reflect the
        amount of light it senses.
       </li>
       <li>
        A cube that has likes people but has a limit to the amount of social
        interaction. It glows until it senses human motion via a passive
        infrared sensor. After a prolonged period of time with a lot of motion,
        it "tires out" and "closes up" by becoming very dim.
       </li>
       <li>
        A cube that likes to be spoken to softly. Similar to the above, it emits
        a glow that invites users to approach it. It changes color as it is
        spoken to. If it is spoken to in a very loud voice, it will become very
        dim.

       3 sensors that can be useful in implementing intangible interaction:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A force-sensitive resistor can be useful for intangible interactions, as
        long as it's not measuring the force applied from a user's hands or
        arms! They can be used to sense weight and to sense whether objects have
        been placed in a certain area.
       </li>
       <li>
        RFID can be used to sense when a tagged object is placed close to the
        sensor.
       </li>
       <li>
        Piezoelectric sensors are used for both microphones and accelerometers.
        Maybe we can use a microphone to detect movement?
       </li>

      <p>
       I tried out the ADPS9960 gesture sensor and made a small project with it!
       The ADPS9960 includes a light and color sensor. I used the light sensor
       to determine if the room was dark, and changes the color scheme of the
       computer based to match the room.
