      Feels like it's just giving historical context into why there didn't use
      to be a true public sphere.

      Either I didn't understand this piece, or I just truly don't have that
      many remarks about it.

      The naive assumption of tech companies is that the only things that
      they're moderating are truth and lies, but in reality it's a lot less
      black and white.

      "The most prominent example at the moment is the ongoing impeachment
      hearing: despite listening to identical witness testimony each day, media
      reports vary wildly along partisan (rather than religious) lines."

      Today I learned what the Estates were. My new colloquial definition is
      that Estates refers to the classes in people in society who wield power
      and influence. The Fourth Estate is the media, and according to this
      piece, the Fifth Estate is social media? Social media platforms? Something
      like that.
     </li>

      A point that I disagree with, or perhaps the piece just didn't go into in
      depth -- the piece seems to imply that democracy needs consensus. I think
      that this is true for some things, like picking a president, but for most
      decisions, pretending like everyone agrees is a great way to alienate the
      losing side. Here's a tweet that I felt like was insightful: "The Framers
      divided Congress against itself (bicameralism) because disunity is good
      for democracy."

       Update: oops I didn't read this part: " The tension itself is not new —
       the history of media is in part the history of managing it — but the
       severity with which it is manifesting today, is." The author does address
       it.

       "Tristan Harris and the Center for Humane Technology, and Tobias Rose
       Stockwell, currently at NYU, have each made tangible suggestions toward
       rethinking specific design choices and incentive structures that push
       users into malign communities or warp them into perpetually outraged,
       aggrieved trolls."

      A tweet that I thought was interesting -- this person defines what values
      means, and says that "it's almost impossible to respect someone who
      doesn't share your few real values." Could be relevant to public spaces,
      since putting people who don't have respect together can result in
      unproductive conversations.
