           The first half of the idea for my final project comes what I
           considered at the time a minor detail in the buildout of my Project
           2.

           I used aluminum foil to make "wires" that wouldn't stick out when run
           along the underside of my laptop. It worked great for my project, and
           over the past few weeks, I left the foil attached to the underside of
           my computer, just because. In fact, they're still stuck underneath as
           I'm typing this.
          </p>
          <p>
           I noticed a great property of these flat, sticky wires -- they're
           super durable, and they're unobtrusively pleasant. Maybe I can find
           more applications for this?

          <p>The second half of the idea came from two observations:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Many analog input devices are implemented as a resistor.</li>
           <li>
            When doing some of the earlier labs, I was annoyed that sometimes
            when taking voltage or resistance measurements with a multimeter, my
            fingers would inadvertently cause variation in the reading.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           So then I thought... use fingers to manipulate a resistor, when my
           fingers could <em>be</em> the resistor?

           My Project 2 concept: A kind of input device that consists of two (or
           more) metal strips running in parallel. The user can press in the
           space between the two strips, and their finger will connect the
           strips (albeit with some resistance), in a way that can be sensed.
          </p>
          <p>
           I will try to apply this sensor to the following use case: By running
           this sensor along the an entire wall, it should be possible for
           people to activate the sensor at almost any part of the room. This
           allows the entire device to be used as a remote control, except one
           that's much less complicated than normal remote controls, since it
           doesn't rely on wireless technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am particularly happy to work on this application. I have a current
           opinion that much of the technology we use today is overpowered, "too
           smart" for the applications we actually use it for. By using simpler
           technologies to achieve the same effect, we can make technology more
           secure, predictable, and accessible.

        <p>Okay, enough talk. Let's build it!</p>

         First, I am happy to announce that I was able to continue my trend of
         not changing the Arduino code at all. I need the Arduino to effectively
         measure two resistances, just like in my previous project.

           In my head, I imagined that I wouldn't need to change that much from
           how I made the strips in Project 2. However, I found two differences
           in requirement:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            I needed these metal strips to be exposed at the surface; otherwise
            nothing will happen if the user presses on it.
           </li>
           <li>
            To have enough to wrap around an entire room, I'd need to figure out
            how to make a lot of it quickly.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           A few hours of thinking and researching later, I figured out that:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            The ideal kind of product would be a form of metal tape, with metal
            on one side and adhesive on the other.
           </li>
           <li>
            This is already a product that people make and that I could buy.
           </li>
           <li>
            In fact, I had already bought some of it at the beginning of the
            semester, and it had been sitting in my room the entire time!

           Sidenote: Video compression is very efficient. Can you believe this
           entire video is the size of a large-ish photo (1.4 MB)?

           It took me some thinking to figure out how to attach the strips on
           the wall to the Arduino. I knew it was going to involve alligator
           clips -- coincidentally, I needed to use 3 alligator wires together,
           and I already had 3 of them twist-tied together from Project 1.
          </p>
          <p>
           I realized that I couldn't alligator-clip it to the wall, because it
           would pull the tape off. So I used more copper tape to connect the
           wall strips to a fixed mounting point on the table. (I had a wall
           plug adapter lying around, so I decied to use use it.)

           It did! And then I tried to record a video, and it didn't the second
           time around. What happened?
          </p>
          <p>
           Note the part where I stuck some copper tape more copper tape. My
           suspicision is that the adhesive was slightly moist before
           application and conducted water, but became less conductive as it
           tried. I fixed this in a hacky way -- I curled the top strip over
           itself slightly, so that the tops of the strips would touch.
          </p>
          <p>And then it worked once again!</p>

           Even with the finger touching, the measured voltage is quite low. I
           tested whether licking my finger would help lower the resistance and
           make for a more significant reading. It did :)

          Do something when the sensor is activated! My current plan is to use

          Investivate whether my Arduino can be used to directly control my
