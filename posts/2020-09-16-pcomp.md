# PComp Labs Week 1

Hello, world! This is my first ITP blog post, in which I document my first lab for the Introduction to Physical Computing class!

## Beforehand: Setting up documentation

Since this is my first time documenting a process at ITP, I (1) had to set up this blog. Here it is!

... and (2) had to create a camera setup for capturing my process. Here's what it looks like:

Equipment shown:

- A long table and a over-the-bed adjustable desk. I love both of these.
- A monitor (mine happens to be a 40" TV).
- An iPhone
- The phone is sort of precariously mounted onto a tripod, streaming to a Apple TV 3rd gen via AirPlay and connected to the monitor, so that it was easy to make sure my hands were always in frame. This seems complicated but I'm just making do with the equipment I have.
- A nice aesthetic light I randomly got from IKEA a few years back. It has an internal battery and charges via USB, which is quite nice.
- A Sony NEX-6 digital mirrorless camera. I couldn't use my phone to take pictures because it was recording the time lapse videos.

None of this equipment was super expensive! I bought most of this stuff used.

## Lab 3: Switches and Pushbuttons

### Make your own switch

I made a switch that turns on when I close my laptop lid!

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/owvelvwf/posts/images/uSgqgWUQsUei42ukqnDnAHZq.gif)

My initial thought was that I could use the lid as a conductor, and so I could put the clips anywhere I wanted. It turns out that homehow the MacBook body doesn't conduct electricity? Perhaps there's some nonconductive coating on it. I work around that, I positioned the clips so that they would touch when the lid was closed.

### Project 1: Three switches in parallel

### Project 2: Three switches in series

![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/owvelvwf/posts/images/oJhHDjvhQqAStFm86d4DStYW.jpg)

### Project 3: Switching a motor

I didn't do this part! This project requires motor and a dual-pole switch, neither of which I had available.
