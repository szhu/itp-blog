      >Make a brief blog post about your tour to the exhibition, answering some
      of the questions below:</i
     >
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>Which exhibition did you see? How did you feel about the show?&nbsp;</i>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      I saw the "seeing machines" virtual exhibit, featuring camera-activated
      works from Zach Leiberman and Gilman Levin.
     </li>
     <li>
      Most of the projects all involved taking a video feed as input and
      transforming it in some way. Levin's Snout was quite different â€” it is a
      giant roof-mounted pseudo-organism that responds to visual stimuli.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>What is your favorite work if you had?&nbsp;</i></p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Levin's Augmented Hand Series was the most thought-provoking for me.
     </li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>What did you like about the piece?&nbsp;</i></p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      The piece uses an all-too-familiar sensor (a camera), and the interaction
      "place hand under screen" is simple as well. The piece feels powerful
      because the occlusion of the user's hand, combined with the placement of
      the virtual hand in the same position, leads to a illusion of feeling like
      the user's real hand has actually been transformed. It's a simple trick
      that makes one think about where their sense of self comes from.
     </li>
     <li>
      I love that the amusement that this piece generates is not from its use of
      novel or rare input/output, or its extravagance, but entirely from
      placement.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>How is intangible interaction used in the piece?&nbsp;</i></p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      A camera takes a live video feed of the user's hand as the user places it
      underneath a surface. This is the only input to the system.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>If you were the artist, what would you have done differently?</i></p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      The display is mounted at an angle. If I could iterate on this piece, I
      would mount the screen flat, such that the virtual hand is closer in
      position to where the real hand is. I wonder if it's possible to use the
      projection technique known as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost" target="_blank"
       >Pepper's Ghost</a
      >
      to make the virtual hand seem 3-dimensional as well.
     </li>
    </ul>
