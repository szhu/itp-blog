      <p>Adjusting my setup is honestly my favorite part of each lab.</p>
      <p>
       Classes are remote, and I got tired of sitting almost the entire day
       every day! This week, I adjusted my setup to make it just as comfortable
       to sit or stand.
      </p>

       I also found some new tricks that allowed me to have a better
       documentation setup:
      </p>
      <p>
       For documentation labs for this class, I typically need to record both
       the screen and the physical world simultaneously. I previously
       accomplished this by taking camera pictures of the circuit juxtaposed
       with a screen. The fidelity on these "screenshots" just isn't super
       great.
      </p>
      <p>
       This week, I going to take screen recordings instead. I am now able to
       bring the real world into the screen using these two tricks:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        When I was reading the help manual for QuickTime Player (reading
        documentation is, for some reason, something I do for fun), I found this
        cool feature:
       </li>
      </ul>

        <p>You can view a iPhone's screen by connecting it to a Mac.</p>

       />
      </figure>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I searched around for an iPhone app that displays just the camera, with
        no decorations around the image. I finally found one called
        <a
         href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/full-screen-camera/id1504011874"
         target="_blank"
         >Full Screen Camera</a
        >
        -- it looks like the developer created it specifically for this purpose.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Putting all of this together, I could now capture both worlds in a single
       screen recording. Here's what the setup looks like:
      </p>

      <figure>
       <img src="../files/2020-09-pcomp/week-6/0_setup/DSC01139.JPG" />
      </figure>
      <p>
       There is a slight lag with the phone screen mirroring, but I hope it's
       not too noticeable.

         ðŸ’¡ This took me way longer than expected to build. I managed to wire
         many wires incorrectly, including having an off-by-one error with the
         Arduino pinout, and forgetting to connect a wire for ground. It was not
         a fun process. :(

         ðŸ’¡ I got very stuck doing this part. After about an hour of debugging,
         I figured out that the issue turned out to be that I was using the
         wrong port name. I was using
         <code>/dev/cu.usbmodem14201</code> (because the examples used
         <code>cu</code> port names) but the correct port name is
         <code>/dev/tty.usbmodem14201</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
         The <code>cat</code> exercise above worked with the
         <code>cu</code> port names! But here the <code>cu</code> port doesn't
         work -- it doesn't cause <code>serial.on('data')</code> events to be
         fired when data is written to the port for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
         Conflating this issue was another issue -- the serial connection often
         doesn't work unless programs are started in this order:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>Upload code to the Arduino.</li>
         <li>Restart the "p5.serialcontrol" app and open the port.</li>
         <li>Refresh the P5 sketch.</li>
        </ol>

         This is was first time using P5. I was impressed by how full-fledged
         the web editor is, and the fact that it was easy for the web app to
         connect to a physical device.
