      No big workspace changes, but now I have a slightly better "camera mount"
      such that doesn't get in the way of my hands:

    <section id="Sending and displaying multiple serial data">
      <md>
        In this setup, the Arduino sends a message containing the readings from
        the two analog potentiometers and the pushbutton switch, separated by
        commas. The computer reads the serial input until the newline, and
        parses it accordingly.
        <!--  -->
        The result is displayed as a circle on the screen, with its X and Y
        position corresponding to the analog inputs and with the pushbutton
        hiding the circle altogether.
        <!--  -->
        The given code is adapted for reading accelerometer input -- the
        potentiometers have a different input range. So when I naively ran the
        given code, the circle was out of the bounds of the screen almost all
        the time:

      <md>
        I added code to log the sensor readings -- you can see it in the console
        in the screen recording. I then adjusted the `map()` input range to
        match.

        This new code has the exact same end result, but the Arduino only sends
        data to the computer when requested. Changed P5 code is highlighted in
        the editor.

      The project 2 prompt:
      <!--  -->
      > Come up with a device that allows a person to control media on a
      personal computer using communication between a microcontroller and the
      personal computer using asynchronous serial communication. Itâ€™s due in
      week 10. Blog your idea for next week and come up with a prototype for
      playtesting.
    </md>

    <section id="Initial thoughts">
      <md>
        Media controls... potentiometers... my immediate thought was to make a
        device that uses potentiometers as knobs for controlling media. The idea
        would be for the device to simulate radio-style controls but for the
        media player on th computer. Like in a radio, one knob would control the
        volume, but the "tuning" knob could, for example, cause the player to
        change playlists.
        <!--  -->
        I had a lot of fun imagining this idea, but something held me back from
        committing to it. I had some insightful brainstorming with Natalie and
        Alan from class, and I realized that it was because neither re-creating
        a retro idea nor manipulating audio are what I came to ITP for. From
        this and further discussions about the kinds of sensors we could use, I
        eventually came up with an idea that aligns more with my interests.
        <!--  -->
        The force-sensing resistor is a kind of sensor I hadn't seen before this
        class. I was drawn to how it, even in its raw form, doesn't explicitly
        require a human hand to manipulate it, in contrast to the pushbutton and
        potentiometer. I realized that it could make a good weight sensor.
        <!--  -->
        This reminded me of an idea I've had for a while: a simple accessory for
        a computer that automatically locks the computer when the user steps
        away. There are three current solutions for locking computers when the
        user is not present, each of which has drawbacks:
        <!--  -->
        - Locking after a timeout. (Drawback: Not sufficient)
        <!--  -->
        - Locking when connectivity to a device (e.g., a phone or watch) is
        lost. (Drawback: Expensive. Also sometimes unreliable)
        <!--  -->
        - Locking when the camera stops detecting a face. (Drawback: Unreliable)
        <!--  -->
        I wanted to design a solution that has a low false positive and false
        negative rate and a low cost. Could the force-sensing resistor be the
        answer?

    <section id="Final idea">
      <md>
        When I'm using my laptop computer, I'm generally always putting pressure
        down onto it. Either I'm typing, or my palms are resting on the bottom,
        to either side of the trackpad. The maximum time when I'm applying zero
        force anywhere on the laptop is probably only a few seconds.
      </md>
      <img src="../files/2020-09-pcomp/week-7/2_project_2/IMG_7957.JPG" />
      <md>
        Given this, my project idea is a device with a force-sensing resistor
        that sits below the laptop, between the feet of the laptop and the
        table. The device senses if the pressure changes. If a few seconds have
        passed with no changes, it sense a message to the computer. An app on
        the computer locks the computer when it receives the message. And it'll
        pause the music too, hopefully that satisfies the "media" requirement.
        ðŸ™‚
        <!--  -->
        A possible progression of this project is for the device to use two
        force-sensing resistors, one below either of the lower legs of the
        laptop. No only will this make the sensing more reliable, but it can
        make it easier for device to pick up user gestures involving force. (For
        example, the user can lightly bang both fists on the computer twice to
        skip the current track?)
