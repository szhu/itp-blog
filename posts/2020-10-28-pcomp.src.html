    <section id="Sending and displaying multiple serial data">
      <md>
        In this setup, the Arduino sends a message containing the readings from
        the two analog potentiometers and the pushbutton switch, separated by
        commas. The computer reads the serial input until the newline, and
        parses it accordingly.
        <!--  -->
        The result is displayed as a circle on the screen, with its X and Y
        position corresponding to the analog inputs and with the pushbutton
        hiding the circle altogether.
        <!--  -->
        The given code is adapted for reading accelerometer input -- the
        potentiometers have a different input range. So when I naively ran the
        given code, the circle was out of the bounds of the screen almost all
        the time:

        I added code to log the sensor readings -- you can see it in the console
        in the screen recording. I then adjusted the `map()` input range to
        match.

        This new code has the exact same end result, but the Arduino only sends
        data to the computer when requested. Changed P5 code is highlighted in
        the editor.
