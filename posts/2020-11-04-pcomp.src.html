      It looks like the take-home lesson for the I2C labs is:
      <!--  -->
      - Here is how I2C works. You will not use this knowledge.
      <!--  -->
      - Instead, use a library to communicate with the sensor or choice.

      Anyway... for this week's lab, the sensor I wanted to use is accelerometer
      in the Arduino Nano 33 IoT's built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). I
      was actually trying to get this set up last week, since the example in the
      lab used an (external) accelerometer.

      I finally figured out why it didn't work:

    <md> After fixing the library import, the code worked! </md>
