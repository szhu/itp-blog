      Developing for Arduino is cool, but as far as tooling UI goes, I've been
      pretty unsatisified with my Arduino development experience with both the
      Arduino IDE and the Visual Studio Code Arduino extension.
      <!--  -->
      This week, I found out that Arduino has a new IDE in the works! It's based
      off of Eclipse Theia, which is a VSCode fork. I tried it out and it's
      great. It has all the GUI features of the Arduino IDE -- menu items and UI
      layout are pretty much identical -- but with the VSCode editing
      experience. It's faster than the VSCode extension too!

      It looks like the take-home lesson for the I2C labs is:
      <!--  -->
      - Here is how I2C works. You will not use this knowledge.
      <!--  -->
      - Instead, use a library to communicate with the sensor or choice.

      Anyway... for this week's lab, the sensor I wanted to use is accelerometer
      in the Arduino Nano 33 IoT's built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). I
      was actually trying to get this set up last week, since the example in the
      lab used an (external) accelerometer.
      <!--  -->
      I finally figured out why it didn't work:

    <md> After fixing the library import, the code worked! </md>

      As mentioned [last week](2020-10-28-pcomp.html), my project will use force
      sensors to detect when I am actively using my computer. This week I
      created a technical proof-of-concept, just to make sure that it's possible
      to get the data we need to determine whether the user is using the
      computer.
      <!--  -->
      I put the two force-sensing resistors below the two bottom "feet" at the
      computer, and created a program that logged the readings from these
      sensors in a simple visual way:

    ></video>
    <md>
      Even though the readings fluctuate slightly at rest, it looks like the
      system is more than sensitive enough to differentiate between "hands on
      computer" and "hands off computer."
      <!--  -->
      A potential concern: Many people type very lightly and with their palms
      completely off the computer, right? This setup might be able to figure out
      whether those people are typing. But!! It's probably not an issue, since
      we can just listen for keypresses in addition to pressure.
