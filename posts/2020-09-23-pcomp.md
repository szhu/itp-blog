# PComp Labs Week 2

This is my blog post for working on week 2's labs.

## Beforehand: Setting up the documentation process

Based on my experience doucmenting last week, I modified my set up significantly from last week. My camera is now mounted over my work. Here's what what looks like:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td align="center">Nice, flat view of the floor.</td>
<td align="center">Let's make the background white.</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" width="50%"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1570168/94015063-391bce00-fd61-11ea-8ec7-979abf119cce.jpg">
<td align="center" width="50%"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1570168/94015084-4042dc00-fd61-11ea-90d2-9354755812f9.jpg">
</tr>
</thead>
</table>

Here's what it looks like when I'm getting out supplies:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td align="center">Before</td>
<td align="center">After</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" width="50%"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1570168/94014932-125d9780-fd61-11ea-982d-66936c4da877.jpg">
<td align="center" width="50%"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1570168/94014942-15588800-fd61-11ea-8671-ffca76075d53.jpg">
</tr>
</thead>
</table>

Here's the result!

For this lab, I didn't run into any issues building this, EXCEPT that initially I couldn't get the connection between the computer and the Arduino to work at all. After some time of trying all kinds of software fixes, I realized that the issue was that I was using a bad micro-USB cable. Turns out only some of the transfer data.

## Lab 2: Analog I/O

Also ran into no issues with the lab.
