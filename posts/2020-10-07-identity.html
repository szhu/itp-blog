       Websites that support user accounts typically display the name or profile
       picture of the current user in the corner, as a security measure, and
       perhaps also to reaffirm to the user that their experience is tailored
       just for them. Social media apps take this a step further by reflecting
       the user's identity in a few more places, in subtle ways.

       For this project, I swapped out the online identity that was reflected
       back at me with that of someone else (for this demo, Elon Musk). I made
       this work across a variety of social media sites. Here are some
       highlights from the demo:

       This experience is made possible with a Chrome extension that injects a
       content script into these social media sites as the user visits them. The
       content script does a few structured find-and-replace operations across
       the entire DOM both at page load and when page content dynamically
       changes (via a <code>MutationObserver</code>), replacing both my name and
       profile picture anytime they appear.

       The code is not currently public, but I will make it public when I can.

      <p>Realizations:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Having my name and profile picture displayed everywhere is kind of like
        having a little digital mirror everywhere I digitally go.
       </li>
       <li>
        Seeing a different name reflected back made me think harder about who I
        was.
       </li>
       <li>
        It felt wrong to seeing Elon's name and face in the corner -- it felt
        like I had hacked into his account. (At first, I had a constant urge to
        log out of that account that wasn't mine.) But there was nothing
        unethical at all about what I was doing.
       </li>
       <li>
        Some social media sites have a lot of restrictions around what names and
        profile pictures you're allowed to use on the platform. There are some
        good reasons for this, but most of these reasons don't apply to how
        users view their own identities on the platform.

         you're posting as someone else?</em
        >
        Yes, this only changes how the webpage appears to the user -- I'm not
        hacking into anyone's account! Note that the fact that I can't change
        how other people see my identity on the platform is not a bug, it's just
        not the point of this project. This project is about shaping how users
        perceive themselves, which I think is just as important.
       </li>
       <li>
        <em>Did you try posting as Elon Musk? How would that feel like?</em> I
        hadn't yet. But that was a good idea, so then I did, live. I didn't feel
        much from the experience, but in retrospect, I noticed that I wrote a
        post that I thought Elon Musk would write, rather than something I would
        actually normally write.

        Hmmm.
