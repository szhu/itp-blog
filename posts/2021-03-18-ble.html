         I was really excited about the variety of voting applications that BLE
         could help make easier. However, as I explored each idea, I found the
         following issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Real-time voting applications in rooms with many people (like
          classrooms, conferences) are not feasible, since most BLE peripheral
          devices don't allow simultaneous connections. Also, since these
          applications are low-security, there are not many advantages over
          using the Internet.
         </li>
         <li>
          To make a secure voting booths, fraud prevention would be hard. The
          range of Bluetooth is large enough that there would still need to be
          defenses against fraudulent voting. The most secure idea I could come
          up with is a two-booth solution, where the first booth outputs a
          cryptographically-signed "ballot signature" that the user receives.
          The user then walks to the second booth to submit a ballot with that
          signature. The act of walking from the first booth to the second can
          then be regulated using traditional means (security camera, physical
          barriers, etc.). This is a solution, which potentially feasible, both
          requires more security review and offers little advantage over paper
          ballots, so I decide to not go with this idea.

         Social Thermometer is a room that marks the sentiment of a room based
         on its recent occupants. It is meant to be installed in common areas
         with no permanent occupants, like break rooms and lounges.
        </p>

         Why: Sometimes the people who need the most support around us are the
         quietest. In spaces with many different people, small common areas tend
         to only serve those with the most energy. This is a simple device that
         allows occupants to sense the energy of those around them.
        </p>
        <p>
         To use Social Thermometer, users use their phones to scan the QR code
         on the box, which takes them to an app (or website, once Bluetooth APIs
         for mobile web becomes available). Then, users would tap the sentiment
         (sad, meh, happy) that matches their current mood. The process is
         anonymous, and there is no mechanism to prevent users from submitting
         multiple votes; however, the device will only accept one vote every
         minute (and the app will indicate whether the device is currently
         accepting votes).
        </p>
        <p>
         Over time, the 3 LEDs on the device change to represent the relative
         occurrence of mood of the room. The device will discard older
         submissions, so the current reading will reflect only recent
         submissions. To preserve anonymity, the device wait for a random
         duration (1-10 minutes) before updating the reading to reflect the
         latest submission.
        </p>
        <p>
         Social Thermometer is a good application of BLE, as the entire set of
         interactions that we would like to allow only involve users within
         Bluetooth range. Compared to an online voting system, this solution is
         much more scalable. The only web component — the page the QR code links
         to — can be a static page and would be easy for people to host their
         own copies of. Moreover, the submitted data is not stored on the
         Internet, providing some inherent privacy.

          The client should search for Bluetooth LE devices with service
          <code>e3099389-0215-400b-890e-a91262d6f618</code> and connect to the
          first device found. There should only be one device.
         </li>
         <li>
          The client should write to integer characteristic
          <code>334c7536-1133-4f0e-a4d6-e3cf23f3c6b4.</code> The characteristic
          only supports writing. Allowed values: <code>1</code> (sad)
          <code>2</code> (meh) <code>3</code> (happy).
