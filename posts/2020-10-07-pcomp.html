     complete Project 1!

     This is the first week where I didn't have a significant setup change. My
     egg carton parts holder from last week continues to work well. ðŸ‘Œ

         My inspiration for this project came from the last exercise of last
         week's lab. After wiring up a variable pressure sensor to a servo and
         turning the power on, the servo twitched and pushed itself slightly off
         the table, as if it the plastic cross attached was a leg.

         For this project, I will making <strong>Walker</strong>, a small
         walking robot based on this circuit and code, turning this wanna-be leg
         into something more functional.

         For some reason, I thought that after I put legs on Walker, Walker
         would magically walk. That did not happen.
        </p>
        <p>
         To make feet, I needed something so that Walker wouldn't fall over even
         though Walker is top-heavy. The solution? Really big feet.
        </p>
        <p>
         The feet also needed to be attached to the legs very sturdily. For this
         job, I still didn't have to look past my boba cup. I cut feet from the
         cup rim, and left a T-shaped part of the cup attached as "ankles" for
         attaching to the legs. I curled up the ankles and inserted them into
         the straw feet. Finally Walker could standâ€¦ but not for long.

         I changed the program slightly such that the leg would only move 30Â°
         instead of 180Â°.
        </p>

        <pre lang="diff">
-   int servoAngle = map(analogValue, 0, 1023, 0, 179);
+   int servoAngle = map(analogValue, 0, 1023, 0, 30);</pre

        <p>
         The result was significantly more stable, but now Walker was just kind
         of shuffling around without going anywhere. His feet were too smooth,
         even against a porous surface like cardboard.

         I continued tweaking the legs iteratively, each time taking variations
         on the leg designs that worked best in the previous rounds.

         An astute reader might observe that Walker is moving not forward or
         sideways, but diagonally. Given that that is how some crabs walk, I
         will call this gait a feature rather than a bug.
