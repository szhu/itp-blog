      <p>
       This week's assignment was to come up with ideas for the final project. I
       came up with 10 possibilities:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        NFC tags that allow blind people to identify objects when they hold the
        phone close to them. (Related to Looking Forward, a course I am taking
        about designing for blind users.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Extensions of Apple's Continuity/Handoff technology. For example,
        clicking a link on a phone can open an app on the computer. Or
        implementing something like Airdrop for non-iOS devices. Or a
        third-party device that pretends to be an Airdrop target, but does
        something else with the Airdropped file. (For example, in a party
        setting, users can use this to send track names to the DJ.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Locking the laptop as the phone moves away. (Related to
        <a href="./2020-10-28-pcomp.html">a project</a> I made for PComp<a
         href="./2020-10-28-pcomp.html"
         >.</a
        >)
       </li>
       <li>
        Social networking (post-pandemic). Exchange business cards, see what
        people around you are saying. Chatter for conference-style events.
        (Bluetooth would be used to sense who's nearby, but content posted to a
        central server to allow for moderation and reporting.) Or, an app that
        notifies users if they tend to be in the same place at the same time, so
        that they can consider carpooling together in the future.
       </li>
       <li>
        An art/science installation consisting of an array of BLE-enabled
        devices, like phones or Arduinos. The devices interact with nearby
        neighboring devices similarly to how organisms in a population or
        ecosystem interact, simulating life. (See
        <a
         href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life"
         target="_blank"
         >Conway's Game of Life</a
        >.)
       </li>
       <li>
        A night light or home light that turns on if your phone is nearby. This
        could be useful because if you carry your phone on you, it can
        potentially sense your presence much further away than motion sensors
        can, especially if there are obstructions. Such a system can turn on
        your interior lights to your home before you even open the door.
        (Related to <a href="./2021-02-10-intangible.html">an assignment</a> I
        did for Intangible Interactions.)
       </li>
       <li>
        BLE beacons or NFC tags that allow a device to behave differently when
        placed in different locations. For example, when a laptop is brought
        into a meeting room, popup notifications are disabled, and when it is
        brought near a TV, it casts/AirPlays to that TV.
       </li>
       <li>
        A secondary or alternate (wired or Bluetooth) HID device that allows for
        richer and more direct interaction with the computer. For example, there
        can be dedicated physical controls for closing the current window or
        moving it around.
       </li>
       <li>
        An app that shows how crowded the nearby WiFi spectrum is. This can be
        useful to tell certain people "upgrading your router won't help, the
        bottleneck is that there are too many devices around here".
       </li>
       <li>
        An anonymous box that users can use to drop off feedback or concerns for
        a physical office, event, etc. Content moderation, access, and security
        are a lot easier if using Bluetooth instead of making it online, because
        anyone who is leaving messages necessarily has physical proximity to the
        box.
       </li>
