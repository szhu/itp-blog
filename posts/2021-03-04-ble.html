      <p>
       This week's assignment was to come up with ideas for the final project. I
       haven't committed to an idea yet, but instead, I came up with some
       possibilities:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        NFC tags that allow blind people to identify objects when they hold the
        phone close to them. (Related to Looking Forward, a course I am taking
        about designing for blind users.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Extensions of Apple's Continuity/Handoff technology. For example,
        clicking a link on a phone can open an app on the computer. Or
        implementing something like Airdrop for non-iOS devices. Or a
        third-party device that pretends to be an Airdrop target, but does
        something else with the Airdropped file. (For example, in a party
        setting, users can use this to send track names to the DJ.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Locking the laptop as the phone moves away. (Related to a project I made
        for PComp. <a href="./2020-10-28-pcomp.html">Ideation</a> â†’
        <a href="./2020-11-11-pcomp.html">Final version</a>.)
       </li>
       <li>
        Social networking (post-pandemic). Exchange business cards, see what
        people around you are saying. Chatter for conference-style events.
        (Bluetooth would be used to sense who's nearby, but content posted to a
        central server to allow for moderation and reporting.) Or, an app that
        notifies users if they tend to be in the same place at the same time, so
        that they can consider carpooling together in the future.
       </li>
       <li>
        An art/science installation consisting of an array of BLE-enabled
        devices, like phones or Arduinos. The devices interact with nearby
        neighboring devices similarly to how organisms in a population or
        ecosystem interact, simulating life. (See
        <a
         href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life"
         target="_blank"
         >Conway's Game of Life</a
        >, which does something similar.)
       </li>
       <li>
        A night light or home light that turns on if your phone is nearby. This
        could be useful because if you carry your phone on you, it can
        potentially sense your presence much further away than motion sensors
        can, especially if there are obstructions. Such a system can turn on
        your interior lights to your home before you even open the door.
        (Related to <a href="./2021-02-10-intangible.html">an assignment</a> I
        did for Intangible Interactions.)
       </li>
       <li>
        BLE beacons or NFC tags that allow a device to behave differently when
        placed in different locations. For example, when a laptop is brought
        into a meeting room, popup notifications are disabled, and when it is
        brought near a TV, it casts/AirPlays to that TV.
       </li>
       <li>
        A secondary or alternate (wired or Bluetooth) HID device that allows for
        richer and more direct interaction with the computer. For example, there
        can be dedicated physical controls for closing the current window or
        moving it around.
       </li>
       <li>
        An app that shows how crowded the nearby Wi-Fi spectrum is. This can be
        useful to tell certain people that "your Wi-Fi is slow but upgrading
        your router won't help, the problem is that there are too many Wi-Fi
        devices in this area".
       </li>
       <li>
        A box that can be used to drop off messages for a physical office,
        event, etc. It be like an anonymous feedback box or like leaving flyers
        on a fridge. Content moderation, access, and security are a lot easier
        if using Bluetooth or NFC instead of having messages be submitted
        online, because we know that anyone who is leaving messages necessarily
        has physical proximity to the box. This can potentially be also used for
        voting ("tap here to take a ballot so you can cast it later") and line
        queueing ("tap here to take a ticket").
       </li>
       <li>
        Same-room audio feedback prevention: A computer application that, when
        joining a Zoom call, detects whether other people nearby are on the same
        Zoom call. When someone is speaking, the application mutes the mic and
        Zoom volume on all nearby devices that are also running the application.
       </li>
       <li>
        A beacon and app system that allows users entering a venue to
        immediately connect to the event-provided Wi-Fi network.
       </li>
       <li>
        An "I need help" button for physical classrooms so that students can
        quickly give simple, private-ish feedback to the instructor. This can
        help students who are too shy to give feedback and prevents
        attention-seeking students/class clowns from dominating the room. (Shy
        students probably need to learn how to deal with these kinds of other
        students, but their inability to do so should not block them from
        learning everything else they need to learn in the classroom.) As a side
        effect, using systems like this can make students more familiar with how
        the dynamics of anonymous voting work, and make students more aware of
        minority opinions among their peers.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Update: I polled the class to figure out which project would be most
       interesting and relatable. Idea 10 won!
