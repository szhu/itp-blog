      <p><i>Your project can be based on one or many of the techniques we have covered in the class so far. I want you create a project proposal: hand-sketches, gathered inspiration, etc and document it on your blog.</i></p>
      <p>For my final, I want to make a traffic light.</p>
      <div class="small-block-wrapper">
       <p class="small-block small-block-left">When people typically think of traffic lights, they think of a simple shape like this:</p>
       <figure class="small-block small-block-right"><img src="../files/2022-01-cad/week-10/scale.jpg" height="600" width="900" style="aspect-ratio: 900 / 600;" /></figure>
       <p class="small-block small-block-left">But up close, there's a lot more going on:</p>
       <figure class="small-block small-block-right"><img src="../files/2022-01-cad/week-10/traffic signal.jpg" height="353" width="501" style="aspect-ratio: 501 / 353;" /></figure>
      </div>
      <p>I've never thought about these details, probably because I'm always looking at traffic lights from a distance, and what I'm looking at it, I'm just focusing on the part of it that is of immediate use to me (the colored lights). Besides, all the other details vary between different traffic lights.</p>
      <div class="small-block-wrapper">
       <p class="small-block small-block-left">Something else that I think is cool is the fact that traffic lights are huge:</p>
       <figure class="small-block small-block-right"><img src="../files/2022-01-cad/week-10/2462eb19-813f-469d-b9f1-f4791135b53c-large3x4_Stoplight2.jpg" height="1280" width="960" style="aspect-ratio: 960 / 1280;" /></figure>
      </div>
      <p>For my final, I want to try:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>modeling a traffic from scratch,</li>
       <li>3D printing it a mini traffic light and putting colored LEDs on it, and</li>
       <li>rendering one next to a person, for a scale.</li>
      </ul>
