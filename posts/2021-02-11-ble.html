     I couldn't figure out how to re-solder the micro-USB port back on, so I
     ordered a new one. It finally arrived today, due to some mix-up in the
     mail. So I had to figure out how to do this week's assignment really
     quickly!

      Assignment: BLE device with characteristics

     <div class="section-content">
      <p>
       Use sensors and actuators of your choice. Build a BLE&nbsp;service with
       characteristics with read, write and notify properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ability for a BLE device to "notify" intrigued me, and I decided a
       create a simple "alarm" use case â€” a countdown timer!
      </p>
      <p>
       I programmed the Arduino with a characteristic whose value acts as the
       current countdown time in seconds. When the countdown is adjusted to be
       larger than zero, the device will start counting down, notifying the
       central device at every second (including when the timer runs out).

  Dim LED

  This example creates a BLE peripheral with service that contains a
  characteristic to control an LED.

  The circuit:
  - Arduino Nano 33 IoT. 1 LED connected to digital pin 2.

  This example code is in the public domain.
