      <p>The assignment is to create a flashlight, defined as being anything that is portable and creates light.</p>
      <p>I've always been a fan of putting things together using tape and cardboard.</p>
      <p>For my assignment this week, I put together a small light-emitting device with no added adhesive and flexible materials. In class this week we learned about how to use drills, so I decided to use that, and created a device with the bare essentials. I've always been a fan of putting things together using tape and cardboard, and using neither was a breath of fresh air.</p>
      <p>I actually made two of these.</p>
      <div class="small-block-wrapper">
       <p class="small-block small-block-left">The first version was part of a project I created for another class (Textile Interfaces) while playing around with conductive thread. A CR2032 button battery is is directly connected to an LED on one end, and the other ends of each are connected to hanging thread. When the threads touch, the circuit completes and the light turns on.</p>

      </div>
      <p>I misplaced this first "flashlight" before I could take better photos, so I made a second version. While essentially constructed the same way as the first one (except for not containing thread), I tried to make it more aesthetic, compact, and sturdy.</p>
      <div class="small-block-wrapper">
       <figure class="small-block small-block-left"><img src="../files/2021-10-fab/week-1/process/IMG_4663.opt.jpg" width="3024" height="3024" style="aspect-ratio: 3024 / 3024;" /></figure>
       <p class="small-block small-block-right">The second version is just a small wooden piece containing an LED that fits snugly in a drill hole.</p>

       <p class="small-block small-block-right">Like in the first flashlight, three smaller drill holes accommodate three screws that hold the battery in place. The LED's terminals directly contact the battery. In this version, the entire device is surprisingly sturdy: no amount of shaking can seem to dislodge the battery.</p>
