        As a recap, this project is a single capacitative sensor that is special
        in these ways:
        <!--  -->
        - The sensor is large -- so large that you can hit it without looking!
        It's a piece of copper tape that runs down the length of one of the
        walls of my room. I also attached a piece of aluminum foil to a section
        of it, to make it even easier to press. Hypothetically, the sensor can
        be a significant portion of the wall, if not all of it!
        <!--  -->
        - Pressing the sensor controls my computer, which is across the room.
        Currently, a single press pauses the music, and a press-and-hold turns
        on and off the lighting of my room. Hypothetically, this can be extended
        to more home automation/IoT-like applications. The advantage of this of
        common IoT applications is that no wireless connectivity or internet
        connection is required.

        Here are the main changes made to the build since [the last blog

          Previously, I had three copper lines running down the length of the
          wall. The idea was that the user could either adjacent pair join
          together, given them two "buttons" that could be pressed.
          <!--  -->
          After a lot of testing over the past few weeks, I noticed that it was
          incredibly hard to hit a particular particular wire, or even to hit
          any of the three wires. Because of this, I removed all but one
          "button", and made the tap target even larger by extending it with
          aluminum foil. The result was a lot easier to use!
        </md>
      </section>

      <section id="Building a capacitative switch">
        <md>
          I changed the sensor from a resistive switch to a capacitative switch.
          As Prof. Daniel Rozin advised, the conductivity of hands is unreliable
          -- our skin isn't very conductive unless we've been sweating a little.
          Where as capacitative sensing is fairly reliable. Also, it doesn't
          require two wires, and pressing anywhere is fine!
          <!--  -->
          I tried using [the Arduino CapacitativeSensor
          library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/). It
          didn't work, and I looked into why.
          <!--  -->
          My main problem was more or less self-inflicted. The capacitative
          circuit required a 10MΩ resistor, and I didn't have one. So I first
          tried to fix this by chaining together all the 10kΩ resistors that I
          had:
        </md>

            src="../files/2020-09-pcomp/week-13/1_project_3/process/IMG_9114.jpg"
          />
          <img
            caption="Looks quite nice, actually?"
            src="../files/2020-09-pcomp/week-13/1_project_3/process/IMG_9113.jpg"
          />
        </gallery>
        <md>
          Alas, the combined 100kΩ resistance was not enough. The time it takes
          a capacitor to charge to some significant degree is defined by τ = RC.
          Wikipedia says human body capacitance is "typically in the tens to low
          hundreds of picofarads".
          <!--  -->
          τ = RC = 100kΩ × 100pF = 10μs, or 1/100000 of a second
          <!--  -->
          The code I wrote ran much fewer than 100000 loops per second, which
          meant that any delays in voltage change would have appear instantanous
          to the code. A larger resistor would be required.
          <!--  -->
          I confirmed this in practice as well, by logging the voltage reading
          at every loop as I turned the voltage source on and off. The signal
          was very noisy, but there was generally no indication that it was
          taking time to rise and fall.
          <!--  -->
          So I ended up making my own resistor! I tried a few strategies before
          finding one that worked reliably.
          <!--  -->
          - I first tried using a force-sensing resistor, but it was too hard to
          press it so that it would have the right resistance.
          <!--  -->
          - I then tried to make resistor our of pencil lead, which actually
          worked quite well when testing with a multimeter. But it was hard to
          attach to the circuit, as pencil lead rubs off very easily and it was
          hard to maintain a constant connection.
          <!--  -->
          - I tried using a binder clip to fasten the pencil lead resistor to
          the wire, and accidentally discovered, to my surprise, that the
          resistance of the binder clip itself was perfect!

          Doing all of this took so much time. Here's a snapshot of the tabs I
          ended up with:

          The true moral of the story is to order parts so that they arrive on
          time.

      <section id="Writing capacitance-sensing code">
        <md>
          I never ended up figuring out if
          [CapacitativeSensor](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/)
          worked; I ended up writing my own code based on the code I used to log
          the voltage.
          <!--  -->
          The code quickly alternates the input voltage between 3V and 0V, and
          takes the average voltage reading for the next few loops. If a
          capacitor (me) is attached to the circuit, then voltage reading would
          be closer to the middle rather than the edges, as the capacitor would
          still be charging or discharging.
          <!--  -->
          The sensing code wasn't perfect, and still registers phantom presses
          sometimes. Maybe I'll try using the CapacitiveSensor library at some
          point.

    <section id="Feedback">
      <md>
        Here's the feedback I received in class:
        <!--  -->
        - _This project can be made easier to deploy. It can be made to better
        blend in better with the decor, or it can be made to be part of the
        decor._
        <!--  -->
        - _Normally we are "taken hostage" by how we interact with the computer,
        using only a mouse and computer, but this takes is in a new direction,
        letting us interact in a way that is more integrated into our lives._
        <!--  -->
        A few people expressed that this is something they'd like to use
        themselves, commenting on the practicality:
        <!--  -->
        - _"This demo is amazing. I need this -please!!"_
        <!--  -->
        - _"Want to set one up for me? So I don’t have to get up? Could really
        use this."_
        <!--  -->
        - _"YES I want one as well. How much is it????? Let's get funding for it
        I’ll take two please, thank you."_
        <!--  -->
        - _"I love this! I also want to pre-order."_
        <!--  -->
        Someone commented on the nature of the projects I've made for class so
        far:
        <!--  -->
        - _"The idea is super unique, I could see you are really into this
        direction of combining 2 different things (coding and daily life)"_
        <!--  -->
        Thank you for the support friends, I'll let you know when this is live
        on Kickstarter 🙃 (jk) (unless…?)
