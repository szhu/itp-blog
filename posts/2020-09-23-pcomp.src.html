      Based on my experience doucmenting last week, I modified my set up
      significantly from last week. My camera is now mounted over my work.
      Here's what what looks like:

      For this lab, I didn't run into any issues building this, EXCEPT that
      initially I couldn't get the connection between the computer and the
      Arduino to work at all. After some time of trying all kinds of software
      fixes, I realized that the issue was that I was using a bad micro-USB
      cable. Turns out only some of the transfer data.

          This is the first exercise so far where the code isn't included.
          Here's the critical part of the code I wrote:
        </md>
        <script type="ino">
          int in = analogRead(A0);

          int out = 255 - map(in, 0, 10, 0, 255);
          if (out < 0) {
            out = 0;
          }

          analogWrite(ledPin, out);
        </script>
        <md>
          I had to experiment a bit to get a useful relationship between the
          input and output values. I chose to invert the relationship, turning
          the device into a night-light!
