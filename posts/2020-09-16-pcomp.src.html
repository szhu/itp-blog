<section id="PComp Labs Week 1">
  <md>
    Hello, world! This is my first ITP blog post, in which I document my first
    lab for the Introduction to Physical Computing class!
  </md>

  <section id="Beforehand: Setting up the documentation process">
    <md>
      Since this is my first time documenting a process at ITP, I (1) had to set
      up this blog. (Here it is!)
      <!--  -->
      ... and (2) had to create a camera setup for capturing my process. Here's
      what it looks like:

      Equipment shown:
      <!--  -->
      - A long table and a over-the-bed adjustable desk. I love both of these.
      <!--  -->
      - An iPhone for recording a time-lapse overhead video.
      <!--  -->
      - A monitor -- mine happens to be a 40" TV -- for displaying the
      time-lapse viewfinder.
      <!--  -->
      - The phone is sort of precariously mounted onto a tripod, streaming to a
      Apple TV 3rd gen via AirPlay and connected to the monitor, so that it was
      easy to make sure my hands were always in frame. This seems complicated
      but I'm just making do with the equipment I have.
      <!--  -->
      - A nice aesthetic light I randomly got from IKEA a few years back. It has
      an internal battery and charges via USB, which is quite nice.
      <!--  -->
      - A Sony NEX-6 digital mirrorless camera. I couldn't use my phone to take
      pictures because it was recording the time-lapse videos.
      <!--  -->
      None of this equipment was super expensive! I bought most of this stuff
      used rather than new.
      <!--  -->
      And a note about the post-processing:
      <!--  -->
      - The large GIFs: Taken using continuous shooting mode on the camera.
      Photos -> GIF conversion done using Google Photos.
      <!--  -->
      - The time-lapse GIFs: Taking using time-lapse mode on the phone. Video ->
      GIF conversion done using a Mac app called Gifski. (I've done the
      conversion process before using ffmpeg but it requires finding the right
      args to pass to it. The app does the same thing more intuitively.)
      <!--  -->
      I've had some basic EE experience before, so the labs were pretty
      straightforward to follow -- I mostly just followed the instructions and
      tried to recreate the reference photos throughout the process! I've used a
      ðŸ’¡ to denote insight and questions I had.

      For this lab, I didn't have the listed power source. Instead, I used the
      Arduino's 3V power out pin, which later labs included instructions for.

        The LEDs aren't lighting up! As the lab states, the LEDs require 2V
        minimum to light up. The lab assumes we're using a 5V power source (each
        LED gets 2.5V), but I'm using a 3V power source and there's a resistor
        attached (each LED gets less than 1.5V), so it makes sense that the LEDs
        don't light up.

        My initial thought was that I could use the lid as a conductor, and so I
        could put the clips anywhere I wanted. It turns out that homehow the
        MacBook body doesn't conduct electricity? Perhaps there's some
        nonconductive coating on it. I work around that, I positioned the clips
        so that they would touch when the lid was closed.
