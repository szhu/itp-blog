  <section id="Project 2: Autolock">
    <md>
      I built my Project 2 -- a pressure-sending autolocking mechanism for my
      computer -- according to last week's plan, with basically no modifications
      or extensions. It turns out that doing just the basics reliably was tough
      enough.
      <!--  -->
      This project buildout was particularly long. Instead of organizing my
      process and the challenges that came up entirely chronologically, I will
      group parts together based on theme, for clarity.
    </md>

    <section id="How it started">
      <md>
        First, I'd like to give a shoutout to my friends at Affinity, my former
        employer, for inspiring me to take computer security more seriously, in
        possibly the most fun way possible:
      </md>
      <img
        src="../files/2020-09-pcomp/week-9/1_project_2/inspiration/125179876_4126503817365183_269283905149620529_n.png"
      />
      <md>
        After this happened, I created an open offer for anyone to challenge my
        security practices. This eventually spread throughout the office, with
        various people offering other prizes, with the most common one being
        donuts. (We called it getting "donutted.")
      </md>
      <img
        src="../files/2020-09-pcomp/week-9/1_project_2/inspiration/124424515_373597600566463_373186250449372582_n.png"
      />
      <md>
        Was this challenge fun? Yes! Did it make me better at keeping my
        computer locked all the time? Well, maybe not. I got "donutted" fairly
        frequently, even more than a year later:
      </md>
      <img
        class="small"
        src="../files/2020-09-pcomp/week-9/1_project_2/inspiration/124298280_703843870545056_2098261979532053490_n.png"
      />
      <md>
        This experience has made me think more about computer security, but I'd
        say that it hasn't actually made me better at it. That's why I've been
        especially excited to create a device that can help me with it.

    <md>Now, as for **how it's going**...</md>

    <section id="App architecture">
      <md>
        - I made no modifications to the Arduino code! This was because (1) why
        not! and (2) I realized that having the "ASCII pressure meter" was an
        incredibly useful debugging tool -- and it is used in some of the
        pictures to follow. I instead wrote JS code to parse the this pressure
        meter -- simply by counting the number of `#` characters that were shown
        in each line of the readout.
        <!--  -->
        - The computer code is written in TypeScript using
        [Deno](https://deno.land/), which is basically like Node.js with a more
        modern API and with TypeScript. I've been using Deno off and on for the
        past year (Deno 1.0 was released in May 2020) and it has been very nice
        to work with.
        <!--  -->
        - There are some operating system functions that are done outside of JS:
        locking the screen, querying whether the screen is locked, and querying
        time since last HID interaction. Deno makes it easy to call and
        communicate with external commands. Even reading serial output from the
        Arduino is done using `cat` because it was so easy!
      </md>
    </section>

    <section id="Locking the screen reliably and only when necessary">
      <md>
        There are command-line commands on macOS to put the computer to sleep,
        to shut it down, to restart it, to turn off the display. But for locking
        the screen? Not so much. The most reliable method I could find was
        simply invoking the appropriate keyboard shortcut:
      </md>
      <script type="applescript">
        tell application id "com.apple.systemevents"
          keystroke "q" using {control down, command down}
        end
      </script>
      <md>
        I noticed that in a naive implementation, we would be attempting to lock
        the screen when the screen is already locked. How do we detect when the
        user has unlocked the screen?
        <!--  -->
        First, I [found](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11511419) the following
        script to directly show whether the screen is locked:
      </md>
      <script type="py">
        import Quartz
        cg_session = Quartz.CGSessionCopyCurrentDictionary()
      </script>
      <md>
        One problem -- it is in Python, and the `import Quartz` step takes a
        long time! I decided to make this subscript a long-running process and
        allow it to periodically send the results of the screen-lock query back
        to the Deno process. Implementing **handshaking** allowed the Python
        process to not use too much CPU!
        <!--  -->
        Something about the script was still not working. (Late note: I think
        the problem might have been that I followed the first piece of code in
        the answer without reading it all.) I added a second line of defense to
        check whether we're ready to autolock again: we check whether the user
        has interacted with the system. I
        [found](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17966890) a script that prints out
        the number of seconds since the user last interacted with the computer.
      </md>
      <script type="sh">
        ioreg -c IOHIDSystem | awk '/HIDIdleTime/ {print $NF/1000000000; exit}'
      </script>
    </section>

    <section id="Detection algorithm">
      <md>
        Last week, it seemed easy enough to check whether the pressure sensors
        underneath the computer indicate that we should lock the computer. Lots
        of pressure = don't lock, little pressure = lock, and that's it, right?
        In practice, getting this right was the trickest part of the build.
        <!--  -->
        I initially used a hardcoded pressure **threshold** to determine whether
        we should lock, but (1) the input data was fairly noisy and (2) the
        threshold kept changing depending on whether the laptop is placed.
        <!--  -->
        To address the first issue, I added a rolling average calculation -- the
        program would only lock the computer if the average pressure over the
        past 100 time periods dropped below the threshold.
        <!--  -->
        To combat the second issue, I added a **calibration** step -- when the
        user starts the program, they are prompted to remove their hands from
        the computer, so that the computer can sense what "hands off" "feels
        like".

      <md>
        This got much better results, but there would still be false positives
        when I was resting my hand on the computer but wasn't moving it around
        much, and false negatives when the calibration period just happened to
        be slightly less pressure-y than average.
        <!--  -->
        After many algorithm iterations, I realized that a better measure might
        actually be that *standard deviation* of pressure over the past few time
        periods. When a person has their hand on the computer, there will be
        significantly more movement than there would be otherwise, almost
        invariably leading to a higher pressure variance.
        <!--  -->
        The only exception occurred when the person was apply so much pressure
        that it stabilized their stance. I added in a significantly scaled-down
        average pressure to solve this problem.
        <!--  -->
        The final formula: `stdev(pressure) + 0.1 * avg(pressure)`. When this
        "score" drops below the score from the calibration period, we should
        lock the computer.

          I... kind of wanted to avoid soldering for this project. But I wanted
          to avoid using the huge breadboard, and I wanted to create a solid
          product. I found out that you can insert the wires into each other for
          a reliable connection.

      <section id="Running sensor wires along computer underside">
        <md>
          I need to have two sensors on two sides of the computer, so for one of
          the sensors, I would need to run wires from one side of the computer
          to the other. My laptop has very little clearance below it -- having
          wires below it would push it up. I realized that an elegant solution
          would be to use **aluminum foil** as wires.

      <md>
        Pressure sensors below an already fairly-heavy object were not as
        sensitive as I imagined -- I remaining issue I had was the computer was
        autolocking sometimes when I was using my trackpad with a single finger,
        super lightly. I added a piece of foam below the computer for added
        elasticity and this solved the problem.

        - _I feel like this has a ton of practical applications1 Love it_
        <!--  -->
        - _Wow, I love how you used calculations instead of hard-coding
        thresholds that allow for flexibility_
        <!--  -->
        - _I feel like this is pretty accessible which I like, but what happens
        if someone is unable to put enough pressure? Is there a low threshold
        that remaps to a different scale?_
        <!--  -->
        - _So cool how you made all your parts into such minimal style! Love the
        idea!_
