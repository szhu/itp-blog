          The first half of the idea for my final project comes what I
          considered at the time a minor detail in the buildout of my Project 2.
          <!--  -->
          Here it is:

          I used aluminum foil to make "wires" that wouldn't stick out when run
          along the underside of my laptop. It worked great for my project, and
          over the past few weeks, I left the foil attached to the underside of
          my computer, just because. In fact, they're still stuck underneath as
          I'm typing this.
          <!--  -->
          I noticed a great property of these flat, sticky wires -- they're
          super durable, and they're unobtrusively pleasant. Maybe I can find
          more applications for this?

          The second half of the idea came from two observations:
          <!--  -->
          - Many analog input devices are implemented as a resistor.
          <!--  -->
          - When doing some of the earlier labs, I was annoyed that sometimes
          when taking voltage or resistance measurements with a multimeter, my
          fingers would inadvertently cause variation in the reading.
          <!--  -->
          So then I thought... use fingers to manipulate a resistor, when my
          fingers could _be_ the resistor?

      <section id="Concept">
        <md>
          My Project 2 concept: A kind of input device that consists of two (or
          more) metal strips running in parallel. The user can press in the
          space between the two strips, and their finger will connect the strips
          (albeit with some resistance), in a way that can be sensed.
          <!--  -->
          I will try to apply this sensor to the following use case: By running
          this sensor along the an entire wall, it should be possible for people
          to activate the sensor at almost any part of the room. This allows the
          entire device to be used as a remote control, except one that's much
          less complicated than normal remote controls, since it doesn't rely on
          wireless technologies.
          <!--  -->
          I am particularly happy to work on this application. I have a current
          opinion that much of the technology we use today is overpowered, "too
          smart" for the applications we actually use it for. By using simpler
          technologies to achieve the same effect, we can make technology more
          secure, predictable, and accessible.

        Okay, enough talk. Let's build it!
        <!--  -->
        First, I am happy to announce that I was able to continue my trend of
        not changing the Arduino code at all. I need the Arduino to effectively
        measure two resistances, just like in my previous project.

      <section id="Obtaining metal tape">
        <md>
          In my head, I imagined that I wouldn't need to change that much from
          how I made the strips in Project 2. However, I found two differences
          in requirement:
          <!--  -->
          - I needed these metal strips to be exposed at the surface; otherwise
          nothing will happen if the user presses on it.
          <!--  -->
          - To have enough to wrap around an entire room, I'd need to figure out
          how to make a lot of it quickly.
          <!--  -->
          A few hours of thinking and researching later, I figured out that:
          <!--  -->
          1. The ideal kind of product would be a form of metal tape, with metal
          on one side and adhesive on the other.
          <!--  -->
          2. This is already a product that people make and that I could buy.
          <!--  -->
          3. In fact, I had already bought some of it at the beginning of the
          semester, and it had been sitting in my room the entire time!

          Sidenote: Video compression is very efficient. Can you believe this
          entire video is the size of a large-ish photo (1.4 MB)?
          <!--  -->
          It took me some thinking to figure out how to attach the strips on the
          wall to the Arduino. I knew it was going to involve alligator clips --
          coincidentally, I needed to use 3 alligator wires together, and I
          already had 3 of them twist-tied together from Project 1.
          <!--  -->
          I realized that I couldn't alligator-clip it to the wall, because it
          would pull the tape off. So I used more copper tape to connect the
          wall strips to a fixed mounting point on the table. (I had a wall plug
          adapter lying around, so I decied to use use it.)

          It did! And then I tried to record a video, and it didn't the second
          time around. What happened?
          <!--  -->
          Note the part where I stuck some copper tape more copper tape. My
          suspicision is that the adhesive was slightly moist before application
          and conducted water, but became less conductive as it tried. I fixed
          this in a hacky way -- I curled the top strip over itself slightly, so
          that the tops of the strips would touch.
          <!--  -->
          And then it worked once again!

          Even with the finger touching, the measured voltage is quite low. I
          tested whether licking my finger would help lower the resistance and
          make for a more significant reading. It did :)

        - Wrap the strips around my room a little more.
        <!--  -->
        - I kind of liked the aesthetic of aluminum more. I wonder if I can buy
        aluminum strips...
        <!--  -->
        - Do something when the sensor is activated! My current plan is to use
        to adjust the volume on my music -- this is probably the most common
        task I'd want to do. Maybe pressing both sensors at once can play/pause
        the music as well. Or perhaps it can toggle my room light?
        <!--  -->
        - Make the sensor as accurate and as free from interference as possible.
        <!--  -->
        - Investivate whether my Arduino can be used to directly control my
        computer using keyboard input. (I don't think the Arduino Nano 33 IoT
        can do this, but I need to double-check.)
        <!--  -->
        - Come up with a better wiring plan for connecting wall to computer. I
        wonder if I can repurpose some USB cables for the wiring?
