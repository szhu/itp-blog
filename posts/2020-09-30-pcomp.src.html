    <md>
      So far, I've still been storing and organizing my parts in the bags they
      came in. Turns out, having a lot of tiny parts in flat bags stacked on top
      of each other is not the best way to find things!

    <md>
      I wanted to find a container that has a lot of different subcompartments,
      so that I can use each one to hold a different kind of part. I was about
      to order something like a pill box...

      ...when I got hungry and made food. I made some fried rice happened to use
      the last egg in the carton. Lo and behold, my new organization strategy
      was right in front of me!

    <md>
      Organizing my compartments this way ended up saving me a lot of time,
      frustration, and eyestrain compared to last week's lab -- I'd highly
      recommend it!

      Note that the resistors and LEDs are pushed into foam blocks. This way
      they'll stay together even if the container gets jostled! I used the foam
      that came with the Arduino.

        I found that using `Serial.println` to log multiple lines gets pretty
        hard to read because of the fast-scrolling input, so I created
        `debugInt` to help with that.
      </md>

      <pre collapsed lang="ino">
#define debugInt(varname, suffix) \
    Serial.print(#varname);         \
    Serial.print(" = ");            \
    printLpad((varname), 3);        \
    Serial.print((suffix));

  void printLpad(int x, int length) {
    int digits = x == 0 ? 1 : floor(log10(abs(x))) + 1;
    for (int i = digits; i < length; i++) {
      Serial.print(" ");
    }
    Serial.print(x);
  }
      </pre>

      <md>How it's used:</md>
      <pre lang="ino">
void loop() {
  int sensorReading = ...
  debugInt(sensorReading, " ; ");

  int frequency = ...;
  debugInt(frequency, "\n");
}
      </pre>

      <md>The output looks like:</md>
      <pre lang="out">
  sensorReading =   0; frequency = 300
  sensorReading = 603; frequency = 617
  sensorReading = 877; frequency = 761
  sensorReading = 923; frequency = 785
  sensorReading = 159; frequency = 383
  sensorReading =  35; frequency = 318
  sensorReading = 773; frequency = 706
  sensorReading = 914; frequency = 781
  sensorReading =   5; frequency = 302
  sensorReading = 720; frequency = 678
  sensorReading = 916; frequency = 782

        Modifications from the given code:
        <!--  -->
        - Increased `threshold`: `10` -> `100`
        <!--  -->
        - The given code did not play a continuous tone -- it would click
        continuously as each call to `tone()` overrode the previous call to
        `tone()`. These two changes largely mitigated the problem.
        <!--  -->
        -- Increased `noteDuration`: `20` -> `300`.
        <!--  -->
        -- Added `delay(noteDuration);` at the end of `loop()`. (`tone()`
        appears to play the tone asynchronously, so we should add a slightly
        long delay to reduce the amount of clicking.)
