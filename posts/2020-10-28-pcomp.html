       No big workspace changes, but now I have a slightly better "camera mount"
       such that doesn't get in the way of my hands:

        Sending and displaying multiple serial data

        <p>
         In this setup, the Arduino sends a message containing the readings from
         the two analog potentiometers and the pushbutton switch, separated by
         commas. The computer reads the serial input until the newline, and
         parses it accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
         The result is displayed as a circle on the screen, with its X and Y
         position corresponding to the analog inputs and with the pushbutton
         hiding the circle altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
         The given code is adapted for reading accelerometer input -- the
         potentiometers have a different input range. So when I naively ran the
         given code, the circle was out of the bounds of the screen almost all
         the time:

         I added code to log the sensor readings -- you can see it in the
         console in the screen recording. I then adjusted the
         <code>map()</code> input range to match.

         Media controls... potentiometers... my immediate thought was to make a
         device that uses potentiometers as knobs for controlling media. The
         idea would be for the device to simulate radio-style controls but for
         the media player on th computer. Like in a radio, one knob would
         control the volume, but the "tuning" knob could, for example, cause the
         player to change playlists.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had a lot of fun imagining this idea, but something held me back from
         committing to it. I had some insightful brainstorming with Natalie and
         Alan from class, and I realized that it was because neither re-creating
         a retro idea nor manipulating audio are what I came to ITP for. From
         this and further discussions about the kinds of sensors we could use, I
         eventually came up with an idea that aligns more with my interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         The force-sensing resistor is a kind of sensor I hadn't seen before
         this class. I was drawn to how it, even in its raw form, doesn't
         explicitly require a human hand to manipulate it, in contrast to the
         pushbutton and potentiometer. I realized that it could make a good
         weight sensor.
        </p>
        <p>
         This reminded me of an idea I've had for a while: a simple accessory
         for a computer that automatically locks the computer when the user
         steps away. There are three current solutions for locking computers
         when the user is not present, each of which has drawbacks:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>Locking after a timeout. (Drawback: Not sufficient)</li>
         <li>
          Locking when connectivity to a device (e.g., a phone or watch) is
          lost. (Drawback: Expensive. Also sometimes unreliable)
         </li>
         <li>
          Locking when the camera stops detecting a face. (Drawback: Unreliable)
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         I wanted to design a solution that has a low false positive and false
         negative rate and a low cost. Could the force-sensing resistor be the
         answer?

        <p>
         When I'm using my laptop computer, I'm generally always putting
         pressure down onto it. Either I'm typing, or my palms are resting on
         the bottom, to either side of the trackpad. The maximum time when I'm
         applying zero force anywhere on the laptop is probably only a few
         seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given this, my project idea is a device with a force-sensing resistor
         that sits below the laptop, between the feet of the laptop and the
         table. The device senses if the pressure changes. If a few seconds have
         passed with no changes, it sense a message to the computer. An app on
         the computer locks the computer when it receives the message. And it'll
         pause the music too, hopefully that satisfies the "media" requirement.
         ðŸ™‚
        </p>
        <p>
         A possible progression of this project is for the device to use two
         force-sensing resistors, one below either of the lower legs of the
         laptop. No only will this make the sensing more reliable, but it can
         make it easier for device to pick up user gestures involving force.
         (For example, the user can lightly bang both fists on the computer
         twice to skip the current track?)
