      What is your definition of intangible interaction?
     </header>
     <div class="section-content">
      <p>
       Normally, to interact with the digital world, we need some kind of
       explicit physical interaction. For example we would type on a keyboard
       mouse, or in more recent times, press on a touchscreen. What's common to
       all of these input methods is that they require the use of hands to do an
       action that wouldn't otherwise take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       More recently, digital devices also have other input methods,
       specifically cameras and microphones, but most existing applications of
       these sensors requires them to be used in conjunction with a tangible
       interaction — for example, by tapping the shutter button in a camera app
       — to perform a meaningful action. Thus, these experiences are still gated
       on tangible interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intangible interactions are those that don't require tangible
       interactions to produce a meaningful action or result.

      What is your favorite project that involves intangible interaction?
     </header>
     <div class="section-content">
      <p>
       I have a hard time picking favorites, but the project that lives
       rent-free in my head is an experience is an installation where a mini
       soccer field was projected onto the floor, complete with a soccer ball.
       Passersby who walked onto the fake field could kick the fake soccer ball
       around, and the projected ball would move as if it were real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure this was an art project at some point, but by the time I saw it,
       it seems like this kind of experience had already been fairly commified —
       I saw it in a shopping mall.

      Have you seen any projects that trick your senses with sensory illusions?
     </header>
     <div class="section-content">
      <p>
       I've seen quite a few projects that use sensory illusions to make you
       feel like you're manipulating the real world. I think the current
       hallmark of that is probably VR headsets, which present a complete,
       simulated visual field of view. My main gripe with devices and projects
       that use all-encompassing illusions is that it almost never looks or
       feels as good as the real thing, unless Apple-like levels of R&amp;D have
       been poured into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen a lot of very convincing illusions in everyday electronics. One
       example that comes to mind is noise cancellation — which generates more
       noise to cancel out existing noise. Another example: MacBook computers
       made after 2015 don't have have a trackpad button that physically clicks
       — a fine-tuned motor generates a quick vibration such that it feels like
       there's a physical button.

      What is the relationship among intangible interaction, multi sensory
      experience and human perception?
     </header>
     <div class="section-content">
      <p>
       Traditional interactive experiences include intentionally designed
       experiences, like bars and live concerts, which we have spent thousands
       of years iterating upon. Interactive experiences also include activities
       that are part of our daily routine, like walking to a destination or
       cooking, which our senses have evolved over hundreds of thousands of
       years to do well.
      </p>
      <p>
       We make use of a wide variety of tangible and intangible interactions for
       all of these experiences, but when we use digital interactive
       experiences, the intangible interactions are extremely limited. To be
       able to enjoy digital interactions to the same extent, I think we need to
       create a similarly diverse palette of intangible interactions.
