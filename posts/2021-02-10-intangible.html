        What is your definition of intangible interaction?

       <div class="section-content">
        <p>
         Normally, to interact with the digital world, we need some kind of
         explicit physical interaction. For example we would type on a keyboard
         mouse, or in more recent times, press on a touchscreen. What's common
         to all of these input methods is that they require the use of hands to
         do an action that wouldn't otherwise take place.
        </p>
        <p>
         More recently, digital devices also have other input methods,
         specifically cameras and microphones, but most existing applications of
         these sensors requires them to be used in conjunction with a tangible
         interaction — for example, by tapping the shutter button in a camera
         app — to perform a meaningful action. Thus, these experiences are still
         gated on tangible interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intangible interactions are those that don't require tangible
         interactions to produce a meaningful action or result.

        What is your favorite project that involves intangible interaction?
       </header>
       <div class="section-content">
        <p>
         I have a hard time picking favorites, but the project that lives
         rent-free in my head is an experience is an installation where a mini
         soccer field was projected onto the floor, complete with a soccer ball.
         Passersby who walked onto the fake field could kick the fake soccer
         ball around, and the projected ball would move as if it were real.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm sure this was an art project at some point, but by the time I saw
         it, it seems like this kind of experience had already been fairly
         commified — I saw it in a shopping mall.

        Have you seen any projects that trick your senses with sensory
        illusions?
       </header>
       <div class="section-content">
        <p>
         I've seen quite a few projects that use sensory illusions to make you
         feel like you're manipulating the real world. I think the current
         hallmark of that is probably VR headsets, which present a complete,
         simulated visual field of view. My main gripe with devices and projects
         that use all-encompassing illusions is that it almost never looks or
         feels as good as the real thing, unless Apple-like levels of R&amp;D
         have been poured into it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've seen a lot of very convincing illusions in everyday electronics.
         One example that comes to mind is noise cancellation — which generates
         more noise to cancel out existing noise. Another example: MacBook
         computers made after 2015 don't have have a trackpad button that
         physically clicks — a fine-tuned motor generates a quick vibration such
         that it feels like there's a physical button.

        What is the relationship among intangible interaction, multi sensory
        experience and human perception?

       <div class="section-content">
        <p>
         Traditional interactive experiences include intentionally designed
         experiences, like bars and live concerts, which we have spent thousands
         of years iterating upon. Interactive experiences also include
         activities that are part of our daily routine, like walking to a
         destination or cooking, which our senses have evolved over hundreds of
         thousands of years to do well.
        </p>
        <p>
         We make use of a wide variety of tangible and intangible interactions
         for all of these experiences, but when we use digital interactive
         experiences, the intangible interactions are extremely limited. To be
         able to enjoy digital interactions to the same extent, I think we need
         to create a similarly diverse palette of intangible interactions.

         I picked a night-light with an automatic switch. The light turns on
         when motion is detected, and then turns off automatically approximately
         30 seconds after motion was last detected.

         From observation, there is a white, semi-translucent, rectangular
         window on the device, which is the sensor is likely behind. But what
         kind of sensor is it?
        </p>
        <p>
         From doing some quick research, It looks like there are three common
         kinds of motion sensors:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Passive Infrared sensors, which detects a differential in infrared
          light between two slots. Humans emit a detectable amount of infrared
          light through black-body radiation due to our temperature.
         </li>
         <li>
          Microwave sensors, which emit microwaves and measure the Doppler shift
          in the microwaves that are reflected back, and ultrasonic sensors,
          which emit sound and measure the time it takes for the sound to be
          reflected back.
         </li>
         <li>
          Video cameras with software that detects significant differences
          between adjacent frames.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Which sensor is this device? The video camera possibility was easy to
         rule out, as the window is almost opaque and a using a video camera for
         this application does not make economic sense.
        </p>
        <p>A further clue came from the the texture of the window:</p>

         />
        </figure>
        <p>
         It turns out that that is a
         <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens" target="_blank"
          >Fresnel lens</a
         >, which is a way to construct an otherwise-thick lens using
         significantly less material. Fresnel lenses are also used in
         lighthouses to focus light into a thin beam. Reading the Wikipedia
         article, I realized that I've seen Fresnel lenses also used in overhead
         projectors (only 90's kids will get it) — I've always wondered what the
         purpose was of those concentric ridges visible on the stage on the
         projector.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Fresnel lens definitely narrowed down the motion-detection
         mechanism to a passive infrared sensor. The lens is needed to direct
         light from all directions into the sensor, which otherwise would have
         much narrower field of view.
        </p>
        <p>
         I wasn't able to figure out how the sensors are embedded or programmed
         on the device. I'd assume that a microprocessor handles the inputs and
         is programmed to flip the light switch when a threshold is crossed. But
         does running a microprocessor even save energy compared to just leaving
         the LED light on 24/7? Turns out, very much so! A LED suitable for a
         night light uses around 500 mW, while a general-purpose Arduino uses
         only a few mW. The single-purpose microprocessor in this device
         probably uses even less.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a simple device: the only two errors this device can make are
         turning on when it shouldn't turn on, and not turning on when it
         should. I've been using it for a while, and I've noticed that it's very
         accurate on a technical level. When I'm moving in the vicinity of the
         sensor, the light will always activate, and when I'm in an adjacent
         room, I've never seen it turn on spontaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, this doesn't completely align with user expectations,
         specifically when the user is staying in the same room as the light.
         Reasonable user expectations would be either for the light to stay on
         if the user is in the same room, or for the light to stay off and only
         turn on when the user gets up. In practice, I've noticed that when I'm
         sitting or sleeping in the same room as the light, it will occasionally
         and arbitrarily turn on, resulting in a suboptimal experience. Because
         of this, this light is not suitable for bedrooms, only for hallways and
         rooms where where random light is not an issue.
