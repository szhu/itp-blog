       I built my Project 2 -- a pressure-sending autolocking mechanism for my
       computer -- according to last week's plan, with basically no
       modifications or extensions. It turns out that doing just the basics
       reliably was tough enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       This project buildout was particularly long. Instead of organizing my
       process and the challenges that came up entirely chronologically, I will
       group parts together based on theme, for clarity.

         First, I'd like to give a shoutout to my friends at Affinity, my former
         employer, for inspiring me to take computer security more seriously, in
         possibly the most fun way possible:
        </p>

         />
        </figure>
        <p>
         After this happened, I created an open offer for anyone to challenge my
         security practices. This eventually spread throughout the office, with
         various people offering other prizes, with the most common one being
         donuts. (We called it getting "donutted.")
        </p>

         />
        </figure>
        <p>
         Was this challenge fun? Yes! Did it make me better at keeping my
         computer locked all the time? Well, maybe not. I got "donutted" fairly
         frequently, even more than a year later:

        </figure>
        <p>
         This experience has made me think more about computer security, but I'd
         say that it hasn't actually made me better at it. That's why I've been
         especially excited to create a device that can help me with it.

          I made no modifications to the Arduino code! This was because (1) why
          not! and (2) I realized that having the "ASCII pressure meter" was an
          incredibly useful debugging tool -- and it is used in some of the
          pictures to follow. I instead wrote JS code to parse the this pressure
          meter -- simply by counting the number of <code>#</code> characters
          that were shown in each line of the readout.
         </li>
         <li>
          The computer code is written in TypeScript using
          <a href="https://deno.land/" target="_blank">Deno</a>, which is
          basically like Node.js with a more modern API and with TypeScript.
          I've been using Deno off and on for the past year (Deno 1.0 was
          released in May 2020) and it has been very nice to work with.
         </li>
         <li>
          There are some operating system functions that are done outside of JS:
          locking the screen, querying whether the screen is locked, and
          querying time since last HID interaction. Deno makes it easy to call
          and communicate with external commands. Even reading serial output
          from the Arduino is done using <code>cat</code> because it was so
          easy!

        Locking the screen reliably and only when necessary
       </header>
       <div class="section-content">
        <p>
         There are command-line commands on macOS to put the computer to sleep,
         to shut it down, to restart it, to turn off the display. But for
         locking the screen? Not so much. The most reliable method I could find
         was simply invoking the appropriate keyboard shortcut:
        </p>

        <pre lang="applescript">
tell application id "com.apple.systemevents"
  keystroke "q" using {control down, command down}
end</pre
        >
        <p>
         I noticed that in a naive implementation, we would be attempting to
         lock the screen when the screen is already locked. How do we detect
         when the user has unlocked the screen?
        </p>
        <p>
         First, I
         <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11511419" target="_blank"
          >found</a
         >
         the following script to directly show whether the screen is locked:
        </p>

        <pre lang="py">
import Quartz
cg_session = Quartz.CGSessionCopyCurrentDictionary()</pre
        >
        <p>
         One problem -- it is in Python, and the <code>import Quartz</code> step
         takes a long time! I decided to make this subscript a long-running
         process and allow it to periodically send the results of the
         screen-lock query back to the Deno process. Implementing
         <strong>handshaking</strong> allowed the Python process to not use too
         much CPU!
        </p>
        <p>
         Something about the script was still not working. (Late note: I think
         the problem might have been that I followed the first piece of code in
         the answer without reading it all.) I added a second line of defense to
         check whether we're ready to autolock again: we check whether the user
         has interacted with the system. I
         <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17966890" target="_blank"
          >found</a
         >
         a script that prints out the number of seconds since the user last
         interacted with the computer.

        <p>
         Last week, it seemed easy enough to check whether the pressure sensors
         underneath the computer indicate that we should lock the computer. Lots
         of pressure = don't lock, little pressure = lock, and that's it, right?
         In practice, getting this right was the trickest part of the build.
        </p>
        <p>
         I initially used a hardcoded pressure <strong>threshold</strong> to
         determine whether we should lock, but (1) the input data was fairly
         noisy and (2) the threshold kept changing depending on whether the
         laptop is placed.
        </p>
        <p>
         To address the first issue, I added a rolling average calculation --
         the program would only lock the computer if the average pressure over
         the past 100 time periods dropped below the threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
         To combat the second issue, I added a <strong>calibration</strong> step
         -- when the user starts the program, they are prompted to remove their
         hands from the computer, so that the computer can sense what "hands
         off" "feels like".

         This got much better results, but there would still be false positives
         when I was resting my hand on the computer but wasn't moving it around
         much, and false negatives when the calibration period just happened to
         be slightly less pressure-y than average.
        </p>
        <p>
         After many algorithm iterations, I realized that a better measure might
         actually be that <em>standard deviation</em> of pressure over the past
         few time periods. When a person has their hand on the computer, there
         will be significantly more movement than there would be otherwise,
         almost invariably leading to a higher pressure variance.
        </p>
        <p>
         The only exception occurred when the person was apply so much pressure
         that it stabilized their stance. I added in a significantly scaled-down
         average pressure to solve this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
         The final formula: <code>stdev(pressure) + 0.1 * avg(pressure)</code>.
         When this "score" drops below the score from the calibration period, we
         should lock the computer.

           I... kind of wanted to avoid soldering for this project. But I wanted
           to avoid using the huge breadboard, and I wanted to create a solid
           product. I found out that you can insert the wires into each other
           for a reliable connection.

           I need to have two sensors on two sides of the computer, so for one
           of the sensors, I would need to run wires from one side of the
           computer to the other. My laptop has very little clearance below it
           -- having wires below it would push it up. I realized that an elegant
           solution would be to use <strong>aluminum foil</strong> as wires.

        <p>
         Pressure sensors below an already fairly-heavy object were not as
         sensitive as I imagined -- I remaining issue I had was the computer was
         autolocking sometimes when I was using my trackpad with a single
         finger, super lightly. I added a piece of foam below the computer for
         added elasticity and this solved the problem.
