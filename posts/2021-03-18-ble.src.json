However, as I explored each idea, I found the following issues:\nReal-time voting applications in rooms with many people (like classrooms, conferences) are not feasible, since most BLE peripheral devices don't allow simultaneous connections. Also, since these applications are low-security, there are not many advantages over using the Internet."},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"To make a secure voting booths, fraud prevention would be hard. The range of Bluetooth is large enough that there would still need to be defenses against fraudulent voting. The most secure idea I could come up with is a two-booth solution, where the first booth outputs a cryptographically-signed \"ballot signature\" that the user receives. The user then walks to the second booth to submit a ballot with that signature. The act of walking from the first booth to the second can then be regulated using traditional means (security camera, physical barriers, etc.). This is a solution, which potentially feasible, both requires more security review and offers little advantage over paper ballots, so I decide to not go with this idea."},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Implementing a comment/message board would require a storage mechanism. The Arduino could be augmented with its own storage, a device with more onboard storage like a Raspberry Pi can be used, or submissions can immediately be sent to a computer or stored online.

In spaces with many different people, small common areas tend to only serve those with the most energy. This is a simple device that allows occupants to sense the energy of those around them.\nTo use Social Thermometer, users use their phones to scan the QR code on the box, which takes them to an app (or website, once Bluetooth APIs for mobile web becomes available). Then, users would tap the sentiment (sad, meh, happy) that matches their current mood. The process is anonymous, and there is no mechanism to prevent users from submitting multiple votes; however, the device will only accept one vote every minute (and the app will indicate whether the device is currently accepting votes).\nOver time, the 3 LEDs on the device change to represent the relative occurrence of mood of the room. The device will discard older submissions, so the current reading will reflect only recent submissions. To preserve anonymity, the device wait for a random duration (1-10 minutes) before updating the reading to reflect the latest submission.\nSocial Thermometer is a good application of BLE, as the entire set of interactions that we would like to allow only involve users within Bluetooth range. Compared to an online voting system, this solution is much more scalable. The only web component — the page the QR code links to — can be a static page and would be easy for people to host their own copies of. Moreover, the submitted data is not stored on the Internet, providing some inherent privacy.\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":{"attachment":[{"name":"IMG_2998.opt.mp4","size":3192515,"source":"https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/xrfkaonr/posts/attachments/eITHrJD64lbJAgsufJN1jzS3.mp4"}]}},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Diagrams"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","header":2},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","caption":"System diagram."},"insert":{"image":"https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/xrfkaonr/posts/images/qhEXeX2aswsgGtxDlmjw-p9V.jpg"}},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","caption":"Schematic of device.","span":"half","width":448.5},"insert":{"image":"https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/xrfkaonr/posts/images/kSDbGpFGAWr4HucBR4Yemjp1.png"}},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Bill of materials"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","header":2},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Arduino Nano 33 IoT"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"3 LEDs"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Enclosure"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Printed Label"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Battery pack or micro-usb cable + AC adapter"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Wiring"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Mounting hardware (e.g., Command hooks)"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","list":"bullet"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"Handshake guide"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","header":2},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":"The client should search for Bluetooth LE devices with service "},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7","code":true},"insert":"e3099389-0215-400b-890e-a91262d6f618"},{"attributes":{"author":"mm0ss1o7"},"insert":" and connect to the first device found.
