         A "cube room", an approximately 1-foot cube with faces on the side that
         show the live interior of a real room. A performer or audience member
         would be in the real room and would be able to interact with the
         audience members in front of the cube.

         and I collaborated during the brainstorming phase, and so our ideas
         have many shared elements. Some key fragments:

          that DonNan found, a cube with a simulated interior that responds to
          gestures on the surface of the cube.

          The phone game Monument Valley, in which the player manipulates a
          character moving about many miniature scenes dominated by right
          angles. (I've played the game before, but the actual reason why it
          came to mind was because DonNan had her Zoom virtual background set to
          a graphic from the game.)

          Stretch goal: A white cardboard cube, and a projector that projects
          the output image onto the cube. Otherwise, the cube would be simulated
          in VR.

          An "input" web app runs on each camera input device. (Each camera is
          either a webcam plugged into a computer, or a phone; it doesn't
          matter.)
         </li>
         <li>
          The "input" web app uses the MediaDevices and WebSockets APIs to
          capture camera input and send it over the local network to a computer
          running an "output" web app.
         </li>
         <li>
          The "output" web app collects the video input and generates the cube,
          either in VR, or projection-maps it onto the physical cube.
