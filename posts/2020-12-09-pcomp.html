         As a recap, this project is a single capacitative sensor that is
         special in these ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          The sensor is large -- so large that you can hit it without looking!
          It's a piece of copper tape that runs down the length of one of the
          walls of my room. I also attached a piece of aluminum foil to a
          section of it, to make it even easier to press. Hypothetically, the
          sensor can be a significant portion of the wall, if not all of it!
         </li>
         <li>
          Pressing the sensor controls my computer, which is across the room.
          Currently, a single press pauses the music, and a press-and-hold turns
          on and off the lighting of my room. Hypothetically, this can be
          extended to more home automation/IoT-like applications. The advantage
          of this of common IoT applications is that no wireless connectivity or
          internet connection is required.

           Previously, I had three copper lines running down the length of the
           wall. The idea was that the user could either adjacent pair join
           together, given them two "buttons" that could be pressed.
          </p>
          <p>
           After a lot of testing over the past few weeks, I noticed that it was
           incredibly hard to hit a particular particular wire, or even to hit
           any of the three wires. Because of this, I removed all but one
           "button", and made the tap target even larger by extending it with
           aluminum foil. The result was a lot easier to use!

         <div class="section-content">
          <p>
           I changed the sensor from a resistive switch to a capacitative
           switch. As Prof. Daniel Rozin advised, the conductivity of hands is
           unreliable -- our skin isn't very conductive unless we've been
           sweating a little. Where as capacitative sensing is fairly reliable.
           Also, it doesn't require two wires, and pressing anywhere is fine!
          </p>
          <p>
           I tried using
           <a
            href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/"
            target="_blank"
            >the Arduino CapacitativeSensor library</a
           >. It didn't work, and I looked into why.
          </p>
          <p>
           My main problem was more or less self-inflicted. The capacitative
           circuit required a 10MΩ resistor, and I didn't have one. So I first
           tried to fix this by chaining together all the 10kΩ resistors that I
           had:
          </p>

            />
           </figure>

            <figcaption><p>Looks quite nice, actually?</p></figcaption>

            />
           </figure>
          </gallery>
          <p>
           Alas, the combined 100kΩ resistance was not enough. The time it takes
           a capacitor to charge to some significant degree is defined by τ =
           RC. Wikipedia says human body capacitance is "typically in the tens
           to low hundreds of picofarads".
          </p>
          <p>τ = RC = 100kΩ × 100pF = 10μs, or 1/100000 of a second</p>
          <p>
           The code I wrote ran much fewer than 100000 loops per second, which
           meant that any delays in voltage change would have appear
           instantanous to the code. A larger resistor would be required.
          </p>
          <p>
           I confirmed this in practice as well, by logging the voltage reading
           at every loop as I turned the voltage source on and off. The signal
           was very noisy, but there was generally no indication that it was
           taking time to rise and fall.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I ended up making my own resistor! I tried a few strategies before
           finding one that worked reliably.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            I first tried using a force-sensing resistor, but it was too hard to
            press it so that it would have the right resistance.
           </li>
           <li>
            I then tried to make resistor our of pencil lead, which actually
            worked quite well when testing with a multimeter. But it was hard to
            attach to the circuit, as pencil lead rubs off very easily and it
            was hard to maintain a constant connection.
           </li>
           <li>
            I tried using a binder clip to fasten the pencil lead resistor to
            the wire, and accidentally discovered, to my surprise, that the
            resistance of the binder clip itself was perfect!
           </li>
          </ul>

           Doing all of this took so much time. Here's a snapshot of the tabs I
           ended up with:

           worked; I ended up writing my own code based on the code I used to
           log the voltage.
          </p>
          <p>
           The code quickly alternates the input voltage between 3V and 0V, and
           takes the average voltage reading for the next few loops. If a
           capacitor (me) is attached to the circuit, then voltage reading would
           be closer to the middle rather than the edges, as the capacitor would
           still be charging or discharging.
          </p>
          <p>
           The sensing code wasn't perfect, and still registers phantom presses
           sometimes. Maybe I'll try using the CapacitiveSensor library at some
           point.
