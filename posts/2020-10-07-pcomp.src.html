    This is my blog post for working on week 4's assignment, which is to
    complete Project 1!
    <!--  -->
    This is the first week where I didn't have a significant setup change. My
    egg carton parts holder from last week continues to work well. ðŸ‘Œ

      <md>
        My inspiration for this project came from the last exercise of last
        week's lab. After wiring up a variable pressure sensor to a servo and
        turning the power on, the servo twitched and pushed itself slightly off
        the table, as if it the plastic cross attached was a leg.

        I wonder if that's how
        [Galvani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Galvani) felt seeing his
        frog legs come to lifeâ€¦

        For this project, I will making **Walker**, a small walking robot based
        on this circuit and code, turning this wanna-be leg into something more
        functional.

      <md>
        For some reason, I thought that after I put legs on Walker, Walker would
        magically walk. That did not happen.
        <!--  -->
        To make feet, I needed something so that Walker wouldn't fall over even
        though Walker is top-heavy. The solution? Really big feet.
        <!--  -->
        The feet also needed to be attached to the legs very sturdily. For this
        job, I still didn't have to look past my boba cup. I cut feet from the
        cup rim, and left a T-shaped part of the cup attached as "ankles" for
        attaching to the legs. I curled up the ankles and inserted them into the
        straw feet. Finally Walker could standâ€¦ but not for long.

      <md>
        I changed the program slightly such that the leg would only move 30Â°
        instead of 180Â°.
      </md>
      <pre lang="diff">
      -   int servoAngle = map(analogValue, 0, 1023, 0, 179);
      +   int servoAngle = map(analogValue, 0, 1023, 0, 30);
      </pre>

      ></video>
      <md>
        The result was significantly more stable, but now Walker was just kind
        of shuffling around without going anywhere. His feet were too smooth,
        even against a porous surface like cardboard.

      <md>
        I continued tweaking the legs iteratively, each time taking variations
        on the leg designs that worked best in the previous rounds.

        An astute reader might observe that Walker is moving not forward or
        sideways, but diagonally. Given that that is how some crabs walk, I will
        call this gait a feature rather than a bug.

        I almost forgot that Walker needed some clothes! I used some pieces of
        styrofoam padding to cover up the ugly bits.

      Lessons learned:
      <!--  -->
      - Making things walk is hard.
      <!--  -->
      - Making things walk is _fun_.
      <!--  -->
      - Let boba inspire you.
